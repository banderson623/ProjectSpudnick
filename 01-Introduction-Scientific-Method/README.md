Learning Objectives
===================
_What should the students learn?_

* Understand the reason for using scientific method while exploring new ideas. _(The ritual of the Scientific Method, at this level, is not important – the thought process behind imagining something, building a test, conducting a test and evaluating it is far more important. This should help the students **think** through the idea.)_

Materials
==========
_What is needed?_

* **Notebook** – to catalogue our journey, work out equations and record our findings. They will use this notebook for the duration of this project. So it should be big enough to capture it all. I like pencil and paper, because at this point, it is still the fastest way to write, draw and chart our findings.
* **Pencil** – Nothing fancy, something that allows graphite to be placed in the journal.

Overview
========
_What are we doing?_

* Introduce the Spudnik project
* Examining the Scientific Method

Experiment
==========
_How can we test and understand this concept?_

Admittely this is pretty lame, the experiments will get better.

Quickly write up  a process, using the scientific method framework, for something they can experiment with the next couple of days.

1. Make a prediction
2. Run an experiment
3. Evaluate the outcome
4. Reflect on their prediction, given their findings

Quiz and Assessment
=================
_Did they get it? I am unsure of this section, but maybe a few questions to determine if the core concepts are understood_

* N/A
