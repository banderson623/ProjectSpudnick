Learning Objectives
===================
_What should the students learn?_

* Understand the reason for using scientific method while exploring new ideas. _(The ritual of the Scientific Method, at this level, is not important – the thought process behind imagining something, building a test, conducting a test and evaluating it is far more important. This should help the students **think** through the idea.)_

Materials
==========
_What is needed?_

* **Notebook** – to catalogue our journey, work out equations and record our findings.
* **Pencil** – Nothing fancy, something that allows graphite to be placed in the journal.

Overview
========
_What are we doing?_

* Introduce the Spudnik project
* Examining the Scientific Method

Experiment
==========
_What can we do to test and understand this concept?_

Admittely this is pretty lame, the experiments will get better.

Quickly write up  a process, using the scientific method framework, for something they can experiment with the next couple of days.

1. Make a prediction
2. Run an experiment
3. Evaluate the outcome
4. Reflect on their prediction, given their findings

Quiz and Assement
=================
_Did they get it? I am unsure of this section, but maybe a few questions to determine if the core concepts are understood_
