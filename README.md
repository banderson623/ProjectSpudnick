An n-week long project to build a pneumatic computer controlled potato canon as an introduction to physics, electricity, circuits and coding. This is geared toward middle school aged students. I am not a teacher and this is my first attempt at something like this.

# The Project – Spudnick

I needed to find a project that would be interesting to middle school boys, so I gravitated toward explosions or projectiles.

What I’ve settled a progressive build out of a **pneumatic potato gun**. Each sectionwe will be reading, talking about and _hopefully_ build an experiment to explore the idea.

1. Refresher on the **[Scientific Method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method)** – Question, Hypothesis, Prediction, Testing.
2. **Physics of Compressed Air** – [Pressure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure), how does that potato fly so far?
3. **Basic Electronics** – [Series and Parallel circuits ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_and_parallel_circuits). Building a solenoid based ([Electromagnet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnet) triggering mechanism.
4. **Gravity and Trajectory** – Will this potato hit that house over there? Understanding [gravity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation) and calculating [trajectory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory).
5. **Programming** – Introduce basic programming concepts and build a trajectory calculation application.
6. **Sensing and Circuits** – Connect a digital pressure sensor and [accelerometer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer) to get quantitative values to improve trajectory prediction.
7. **Programming With Hardware** – Connect the  pressure and orientation sensors to an [arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) and use the live data to determine the spud's flight time and distance.
8. **Motorized Tripod** – If we still have time after we cover all the topics above we can combine everything we've learned to build a two axis motorized tripod that allows for pitch and yaw control. I am thinking this would be controlled by the arduino and could allow for precise targeting and firing mechanisms.
